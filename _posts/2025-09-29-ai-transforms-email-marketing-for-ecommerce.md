- **Automated Flows That Never Sleep:** AI powers ecommerce flows like abandoned cart, winback campaigns, and post-purchase sequences, ensuring you engage shoppers at the right moment, every time.
- **Subject Line Optimization:** Testing hundreds of subject lines used to take weeks. With AI, you’ll know which ones drive the best opens—fast.
- **Predictive Analytics:** AI forecasts when customers are likely to buy, unsubscribe, or need a nudge, so you can send the right email at the perfect time.
