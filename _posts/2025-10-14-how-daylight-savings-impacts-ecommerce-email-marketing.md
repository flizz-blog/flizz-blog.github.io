Spring forward, fall back—daylight savings is more than just a clock change. For ecommerce brands, it’s a golden opportunity (and a potential pitfall) for your email marketing strategy. The twice-yearly time shift directly impacts open rates, conversion windows, and even customer sentiment. So, how do you keep your emails for email marketing campaigns converting when the clocks jump?

Let’s break it down, get tactical, and make sure your next email campaigner move is your best yet.

## Why Daylight Savings Is a Big Deal for Ecommerce Email Marketing

You already know timing is everything in email marketing. But when daylight savings hits across North America, The Netherlands, and Denmark, your customers’ routines shift overnight. Suddenly, that carefully optimized send time might land your emails in the middle of a morning rush, a commute, or—worse—lost in a sleep-deprived inbox scroll.

Here’s what the data shows:
- **Open rates can drop by up to 6%** after a time change if send times aren’t adjusted.
- **Conversion rates spike** for brands that sync their email deployment with new customer behaviors post-DST.

That means this isn’t just a minor blip. If you run a Shopify store or manage ecommerce flows, ignoring daylight savings could cost you sales and hurt your email marketing ROI.

## Three Ways to Win Daylight Savings with Email Marketing

### 1. Adjust Send Times—But Go Beyond the Obvious

Don’t just move your email blasts by an hour and call it a day. Use your email marketing email analytics to spot new patterns. Are your North American customers opening emails later? Do your Dutch subscribers now shop after dinner, not before?

**Tip:** Leverage Klaviyo flows or your preferred email mktg platform’s time zone features to personalize delivery. If you use email marketing for Shopify, segment by geography for precision.

### 2. Refresh Your Ecommerce Email Strategy

Daylight savings is a natural reset—a great excuse to tweak your abandoned cart flows, post-purchase sequences, and winback campaigns. Maybe your abandoned cart reminders hit better in the early evening now. Or perhaps your ecommerce newsletters convert higher on Sunday mornings post-clock change.

**Quick wins:**
- Update automation triggers based on recent engagement data.
- Test new subject lines that play on time, seasons, or sleep (think “Wake Up to Savings” or “You Snooze, You Lose”).

### 3. Double Down on Retention with Timely Touchpoints

Customer retention is critical, especially in the wake of schedule upheaval. Use service email marketing touchpoints to check in, offer value, and re-engage lapsed customers.

- **Post-purchase emails:** Remind customers about shipping or review requests at their new “prime time.”
- **Winback emails:** Use the clock change as a creative hook to bring old customers back into the fold.

## Don’t Let Email Deployment Fall Behind

Daylight savings can make or break your email campaign performance. The best email marketing firms know that smart timing—powered by data and a sharp ecommerce email strategy—turns a routine clock change into a revenue boost.
