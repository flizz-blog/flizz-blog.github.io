If you run an ecommerce brand, you already know that email marketing is your not-so-secret weapon. But just how powerful is it? According to recent Statista data, global email users are set to hit 4.7 billion by 2026. That’s not just inbox clutter—that’s billions of revenue opportunities for your store, if you know how to use email marketing the right way.

Let’s break down what this means for ecommerce brands, why email marketing services like Flizz drive real growth, and how you can use these insights to outpace competitors on Shopify, Amazon, or your own DTC website.

## Email Marketing Is Where Ecommerce Wins

First, the numbers. Statista reports show that email marketing ROI can hit 36:1 for every dollar spent. That’s higher than any other channel, hands down. But blasting out a marketing email isn’t enough. Today’s customers expect:

- **Personalized email campaigns**  
- Smart abandoned cart flows  
- Automated post-purchase sequences  
- Engaging ecommerce newsletters  
- Targeted winback campaigns

If your emails aren’t ticking these boxes, you’re leaving money on the table.

## What Statista Tells Us About Ecommerce Email Campaigns

Here’s what’s hot, according to the latest trends:

- **Cart Abandonment Is Still a Gold Mine**  
  Statista data shows nearly 70% of online carts are abandoned. But with the right abandoned cart flows and email blasting services, you can recover up to 20% of those lost sales.

- **Retention Beats Acquisition**  
  The cost to acquire a new customer keeps rising. Email marketing campaigns focused on retention—like winback campaigns and post-purchase sequences—are proven to boost lifetime value and repeat purchase rates.

- **Automation Is the Growth Engine**  
  Free email automation tools are everywhere, but expert email marketing firms get results by combining e marketing strategy with tailored Klaviyo flows and advanced segmentation.

- **Mobile Is Non-Negotiable**  
  Statista highlights that over 50% of emails for email marketing are opened on mobile. If your campaigns aren’t mobile-optimized, you’re missing half your audience.

**You need email marketing that goes beyond basic e mail how to write tactics.**

Here’s what to focus on right now:

- **Build Robust Ecommerce Email Strategy**
