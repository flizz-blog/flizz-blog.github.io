When it comes to ecommerce, the difference between a good month and a record-breaker often comes down to one thing: meaningful connections. If you’re running a DTC brand, Shopify store, or selling on Amazon, you already know the power of email marketing—but connections are the secret sauce. And in May 23, we’re seeing a clear trend: brands that double down on personalized, strategically timed email campaigns are cleaning up.

Let’s break down what’s working, why it matters, and how you can put this connections hint into play to drive more sales and boost customer retention.

## Why Connections Are the Core of Ecommerce Email Marketing

Forget the spray-and-pray approach of old-school email blasting services. Today, your customers expect more—tailored content, smart automation, and timing that feels almost psychic. The brands winning in May 23 are those using email marketing as a service to build genuine connections, not just blast out discounts.

**It’s not just about sending a marketing email. It’s about sending the right one at the right time.**

- **Segmentation:** Targeting specific audiences based on behavior and purchase history.
- **Personalization:** Using dynamic content and smart triggers for every email campaign.
- **Automation:** Setting up ecommerce flows like abandoned cart and post-purchase sequences.

## The May 23 Trend Changing the Game

Here’s the connections hint ecommerce founders need: customers want to feel seen. They want emails for email marketing that anticipate their needs, answer their questions, and offer real value—not just another coupon code.

The top-performing email marketing firms are leaning into:

- **Advanced Klaviyo flows** that adapt to customer behavior in real time.
- **Winback campaigns** that bring lapsed customers back with relevant offers.
- **Ecommerce newsletters** packed with tips, stories, and social proof.
- **Email campaigners** using zero-party data (info customers give you directly) to drive hyper-relevant content.

This isn’t just theory. According to recent data, ecommerce brands using these connections-focused strategies see up to 45% higher open rates and a 30% lift in repeat purchases compared to brands sticking with generic email blasts.

## Quick Wins for Your Next Email Marketing Campaign

Ready to put this into action? Here’s how to turn the connections hint from May 23 into real results:

- **Audit your segments**: Make sure your email marketing campaign targets the right customers with the right message.
- **Optimize your ecommerce email strategy**: Set up automated abandoned cart flows and post-purchase emails. These are proven to drive instant ROI.
- **Personalize every touchpoint**: Use customers’ first names, recommend products based on past purchases, and segment by location (hello North America, The Netherlands, Denmark!).
- **Test and iterate**: Use A/B testing on subject lines and offers to see what resonates in your region.
