Craving that first sip of Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte? You’re not alone. Every year, “when does Starbucks pumpkin come out” becomes a viral trend, setting off a surge in search, social chatter, and, yes, sales. But what does this have to do with ecommerce email marketing? Everything.

Pumpkin season is proof that anticipation drives action. Smart brands take a page from Starbucks’ playbook—building hype, timing campaigns, and using email marketing to turn buzz into buying. Let’s break down how you can use these lessons to craft high-converting email campaigns that are as irresistible as pumpkin spice.

## Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Drop and the Power of Email Marketing

Each August, Starbucks brings back the Pumpkin Spice Latte. The date isn’t random—it’s a masterclass in seasonal marketing. When Starbucks teases the launch, inboxes fill up with marketing emails and email blasts. The result? Crowds at stores, trending hashtags, and a spike in ecommerce activity (yes, pumpkin spice everything gets a lift).

**Why does it work?**
- **Anticipation**: Emails build excitement before the drop.
- **Exclusivity**: “Be first in line” or “Early access” emails make customers feel special.
- **Personalization**: Targeted email campaigns remind fans when and where to get their fix.

That’s email marketing email at its best—driving sales and boosting retention.

## How Ecommerce Brands Can Harness This Trend

You don’t need to be Starbucks to make seasonal magic. Here’s how ecommerce brands can use email marketing services to capture the same energy:

### 1. Time Your Email Campaigns for Maximum Impact

- Launch your emails for email marketing around peak seasonal trends—think back-to-school, Black Friday, or local holidays in North America, The Netherlands, and Denmark.
- Use ecommerce email strategy to plan abandoned cart flows and post-purchase sequences that align with customer intent.

### 2. Build Anticipation With Segmented Email Blasting Services

- Send teasers and countdowns to your most engaged segments.
- Use email deployment tools to automate free email automation campaigns, so your audience gets the right message at the right time.

### 3. Drive Repeat Sales With Retention Flows

### 4. Make It Easy to Buy

- Use email advertising services to highlight best sellers and drive urgency.

## What Sets High-Performing Ecommerce Emails Apart

Top-performing email marketing campaigners know the secret: it’s not about blasting everyone. It’s about the right message, at the right time, to the right person. Here’s what to focus on:

- **Personalization**: Tailored recommendations and dynamic content drive conversions.
- **Automation**: Free service email automations (like abandoned cart reminders) save time and boost ROI.
