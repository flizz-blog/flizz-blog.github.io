Not all email marketing campaigns are created equal—and one overlooked factor can make or break your results: time change. Whether you’re targeting customers in North America, The Netherlands, or Denmark, the shift in local time can seriously impact the performance of your emails for email marketing. Let’s break down why time change matters for ecommerce, and how to turn it into a sales-boosting advantage.

## Timing Is Everything in Email Marketing

You spend hours crafting the perfect marketing email, only to see open rates nosedive. Sound familiar? Too many ecommerce brands overlook the simple truth: send time = results. When time change hits—think daylight saving time or seasonal shifts—your carefully planned email marketing campaign can land in inboxes at the wrong hour. That means fewer opens, less engagement, and missed revenue.

### Why Time Change Disrupts Ecommerce Email Marketing

- **Customer Routines Shift:** People check email at different times after a time change. Your 8 AM “abandoned cart flow” might now hit at 7 AM, when your audience is still asleep.
- **Global Stores, Global Challenges:** Running email campaigns across regions? The time change doesn’t happen everywhere at once. That’s extra complexity for your email deployment.
- **Automations Go Off-Track:** Klaviyo flows and ecommerce retention emails set for specific times can drift, especially if you’re not using dynamic time zones.

## 3 Ways to Optimize Your Email Marketing for Time Change

### 1. Use Local Time Zones for Email Deployment

If you’re using marketing service platforms like Klaviyo, always set your email blasts to send based on the recipient’s local time zone. This ensures your ecommerce newsletters and post-purchase sequences hit when your customer is most likely to open.

### 2. Analyze and Adjust Send Times

Review your email marketing campaign data before and after each time change event. Look for dips in open or click rates. Tweak your ecommerce email strategy—especially for high-stakes flows like abandoned carts and winback campaigns.

### 3. Lean on Experts for Done-For-You Execution

Managing emails for email marketing, especially across multiple regions, gets complicated fast. Email marketing firms like Flizz specialize in handling every detail: dynamic segmentation, time zone automation, and ongoing optimization. That means your email marketing email lands at the right moment, every time.

## Quick Wins for Ecommerce Email Marketing Post-Time Change

- **Resend to Non-Openers:** After a time change, resend your best emails to those who missed them.
- **A/B Test Send Times:** Find your new top-performing time slot.
- **Segment by Region:** Adjust your email campaigner settings for North America, The Netherlands, and Denmark separately.
