Gen Z is rewriting the ecommerce playbook, and if your email marketing isn’t evolving, you’re already behind. These digital natives don’t just scroll—they swipe past anything that feels outdated, irrelevant, or salesy. But here’s the kicker: Gen Z loves email when it’s done right, and for ecommerce brands, that’s a goldmine waiting to be tapped.

Let’s break down how to make your email marketing campaigns click with Gen Z—and why done-for-you email marketing services like Flizz are a shortcut to real results.

### Why Gen Z Doesn’t Ignore Their Inbox

Forget the myth that Gen Z doesn’t check email. Studies show over 85% of Gen Zers use email regularly for shopping, order updates, and exclusive drops. The catch? They’ll only engage with emails for email marketing that hit the sweet spot of value, authenticity, and speed.

What does that mean for ecommerce email marketing?

- **Personalization is non-negotiable.** Gen Z expects emails that know their preferences, style, and shopping habits.
- **Mobile-first is standard.** If your email campaigner isn’t built for mobile, you’re invisible.
- **Authenticity wins.** Forget generic blasts—Gen Z can spot a fake a mile away.

### How Ecommerce Brands Can Nail Gen Z Email Marketing 

#### 1. Design Emails That Don’t Get Swiped Away

Bold visuals, short copy, and killer subject lines grab attention fast. Your emails should feel like an extension of your brand’s TikTok or Instagram—not a boring newsletter.

#### 2. Leverage Abandoned Cart Flows and Winback Campaigns

Gen Z is impulsive but forgetful. Automated ecommerce flows like abandoned cart reminders and winback campaigns (think: “Hey, you left something behind!”) keep your brand top-of-mind and drive repeat purchases.

#### 3. Use Klaviyo Flows to Personalize at Scale

Powerful email marketing services like Klaviyo let you segment Gen Z shoppers by behavior, location, or purchase history. Flizz helps you set up ecommerce email strategy and flows that send the right message at the exact right moment—without you lifting a finger.

#### 4. Prioritize Value Over Volume

Gen Z hates spam. Instead of endless email blasts, focus on quality over quantity. Share exclusive offers, early access to new drops, or behind-the-scenes content that makes them feel part of your community.

### Data-Backed Results Speak Louder Than Words

- **Ecommerce retention emails** can boost repeat purchase rates by up to 45% in Gen Z segments.
- Personalized email campaigns see 6x higher transaction rates compared to generic blasts.
- Gen Z responds 2x more to interactive emails—think polls, quizzes, and shoppable content.
