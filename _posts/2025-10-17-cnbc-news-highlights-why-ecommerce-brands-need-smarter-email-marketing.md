Staying ahead of ecommerce trends isn’t just smart—it’s critical. CNBC news recently spotlighted ecommerce brands smashing growth records and the tactics behind their success. Guess what stood out? Email marketing, and specifically, how powerhouse brands are using done-for-you email marketing services to drive sales, retain customers, and maximize lifetime value.

If you run a Shopify store, Amazon shop, or direct-to-consumer brand, it’s time to double down on your email marketing game. Here’s how top ecommerce players are winning big—plus actionable takeaways you can use to grow, starting today.

## Why Email Marketing Keeps Dominating Ecommerce Growth

Let’s get real. Social media algorithms change, ads get more expensive, and privacy rules tighten. But your email list? That’s your most valuable asset. CNBC news reports confirm: brands investing in high-converting email campaigns are seeing up to **40% of total revenue driven by email marketing** alone.

Here’s why email marketing blows other channels out of the water:

- **Direct access to your customers’ inboxes**
- **Personalized, segmentable, and scalable**
- **Automated flows like abandoned cart and winback campaigns do the heavy lifting**
- **ROI that outpaces paid ads by 4x or more**

But none of this matters without the right strategy, creative, and deployment. That’s where dedicated email marketing services (like Flizz) come in.

## What Today’s Winning Brands Are Actually Doing

According to recent CNBC news segments, the fastest-growing ecommerce brands have one thing in common: they’re not sending generic blasts. They’re sending hyper-targeted, automated emails for email marketing that speak directly to where customers are in their journey.

### Here’s what top brands are prioritizing:

- **Ecommerce email strategy built on data**, not guesswork  
  Think: advanced segmentation, ecommerce flows, and lifecycle triggers.
- **Abandoned cart flows** that recover up to 20% of lost sales  
  Automated reminders, smart discounts, and urgency—crafted to convert.
- **Post-purchase sequences** that boost retention and increase repeat purchases  
  Education, upsells, and loyalty-building content.
- **Winback campaigns** that re-engage lapsed customers  
  Timely, personalized offers that bring back high-value shoppers.
- **Klaviyo flows** for Shopify and other ecommerce platforms  
  Seamless integration, advanced automation, and robust analytics.

## Why DIY Email Marketing Isn’t Enough Anymore

Building, writing, and deploying an effective email marketing campaign—on top of running your store—is a recipe for burnout. CNBC news highlights the rise of email marketing as a service, letting ecommerce brands skip the headaches and scale faster.
